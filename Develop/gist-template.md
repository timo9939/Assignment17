# Regex Tutorial

This is the tutorial that illustrating and explaning what is regex and how does it work. Example will be given with clear explanation.

## üìù**Summary**

Regex stands for Regeular Expression. It is the pattern for matching character and number combination in strings. Also it can be used in the validation such as email input validation. 

<br>
Regex is a case-sensitive language. The criteria must be strict when you use it to match the words. Below is the example to be illustraed in this tutorial

<br>

Example:
<br>

```
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+) @([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```

## **Regex Components**
There are 2 ways to create regex components which are using the pair of slash and pair of quotation. The examples are given below :

`1. Using a pair of slash ` (//)
``` 
/[a-z0-9_\.-]/ 
```
`2. Using a pair of quotation`  ('')
``` 
'ab+c'
```


### **Anchors**
There are 2 characters in anchor which are `^` and `$`. The `^` sign is to match the string that begins with specfic string or character. For instance,`^[a-z]` means match any string with the words start with a-z character. In contrast, `$[a-z]` means match any string with the words end with a-z character.
